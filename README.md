# Common Questions
> Why did you go from paid to free and open source?
#### I figured it was the best way to properly get out there as a struggling developer, and I figured people could also build and learn off of what I create and provide to the community.

> Did the people who purchased in the past get ripped off in the end?
#### Of course not! I always find ways to give back and compensate where it's due. We don't believe in taking money from other's as that promotes the worst evil in all of internet marketplaces, scamming.

> Do you plan on actually pursuing this as a main project?
#### With all of my other projects either being cancelled due to boredom or lack of funding, Paradise Hub will remain on the list until funding is gone (more than likely will happen) or Paradise Hub is merged with another hub (more than likely will not happen)
