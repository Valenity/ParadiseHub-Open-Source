So recently there was a website called cheater.fun that completely stole my code and decided to completely reupload my original loader and throw their name over it.
This is personally not okay as I've spent weeks crafting the best methods to prevent any sort of issue and then a website comes and rips my loader a couple days later.

My original:

Their "Skid-Rip":

I appreciate that they credited me, it's the fact that they threw their name over my work after already taking it from my github.
PLEASE, do not be like the people over at this website and just. do. better.
